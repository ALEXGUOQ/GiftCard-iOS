##Why I Do This?

As a motion designer,it's hard to implement the right effect on device.So i begin to learn some code.
Also I thought beautiful things should be implemented.

##Final Effect

I try to Implement this work in Xcode(First of all,I made a prototype in Origami).I used the Pop framework.
