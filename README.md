# GiftCard-Implementation

##[Chuan²](https://dribbble.com/woodmouse) did a masterpiece 

I love [Chuan²](https://dribbble.com/woodmouse)'s work,it's simple & elegant.
You can see the impressive [animation on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/2045026-Gift-Card?list=searches&offset=0)

##Why I Do This?

As a motion designer,it's hard to implement the right effect on device.So i begin to learn some code.

##Final Effect

I try to Implement this work in Xcode(First of all,I made a prototype in Origami)
